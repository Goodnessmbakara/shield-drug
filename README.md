## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/pnpm
- Modern web browser
- Mobile device for testing (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd shield-drug
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev

## 📋 CSV Schema

The platform uses a unified CSV schema for data upload and export operations. See [UNIFIED_CSV_SCHEMA.md](./UNIFIED_CSV_SCHEMA.md) for complete documentation.

### Quick Start with CSV
- **Upload Format**: Use `public/sample-batch.csv` as a template for batch uploads
- **Export Format**: Download processed data in unified format from batch/upload details pages
- **Validation**: All uploads are validated against the required schema before processing
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Blockchain Configuration
POLYGON_RPC_URL=your_polygon_rpc_url
POLYGON_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key

# AI/ML Services
AI_SERVICE_KEY=your_ai_service_key

# NAFDAC Integration
NAFDAC_API_KEY=your_nafdac_api_key
NAFDAC_API_URL=https://api.nafdac.gov.ng

# Database (if using external DB)
